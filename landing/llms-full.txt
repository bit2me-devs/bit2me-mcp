## 📋 Response Schemas

All tool responses are **optimized for LLM consumption** with clean, consistent structures. We provide comprehensive documentation of response formats:

### 📖 Documentation Files

- **[SCHEMA_MAPPING.md](./SCHEMA_MAPPING.md)** - Complete JSON response examples for all 47 tools

### Key Features

- ✅ **Consistent naming**: All fields use `snake_case` for better LLM readability
- ✅ **Flattened structures**: Removed unnecessary nesting from API responses
- ✅ **Filtered data**: Zero balances and irrelevant fields are removed
- ✅ **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript interfaces in `src/utils/schemas.ts`
- ✅ **Well-documented**: Every tool has a concrete JSON example

### Example

Instead of raw API responses like:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "orderId": "...",
            "guaranteeCurrency": "BTC",
            "loanCurrency": "EUR"
        }
    ]
}
```

You get optimized responses like:

```json
[
    {
        "order_id": "...",
        "guarantee_currency": "BTC",
        "loan_currency": "EUR"
    }
]
```

See [SCHEMA_MAPPING.md](./SCHEMA_MAPPING.md) for complete examples of all 47 tool responses.

## ⚙️ Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18 or higher.
- **Bit2Me Account**: You need a verified Bit2Me account.

### 🔑 Generating API Keys

1. Go to your **[Bit2Me API Dashboard](https://app.bit2me.com/profile/api)**.
2. Click on **"New Key"**.
3. Select the permissions you need (e.g., Wallets, Trading, Earn, Loans).
    > **⚠️ Security Note:** This MCP server does **NOT** support crypto withdrawals to external blockchain addresses or transfers to other users. For security best practices, please **DO NOT** enable "Withdrawal" permissions on your API Key. Internal transfers between your own Bit2Me wallets (Wallet ↔ Pro ↔ Earn) are fully supported.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bit2me-devs/bit2me-mcp.git
    cd bit2me-mcp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit `.env` and add your keys:

    ```env
    BIT2ME_API_KEY=YOUR_BIT2ME_ACCOUNT_API_KEY
    BIT2ME_API_SECRET=YOUR_BIT2ME_ACCOUNT_API_SECRET

    # Optional Configuration
    BIT2ME_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30000     # Request timeout in ms (default: 30000)
    BIT2ME_MAX_RETRIES=3             # Max retries for rate limits (default: 3)
    BIT2ME_RETRY_BASE_DELAY=1000     # Base delay for backoff in ms (default: 1000)
    BIT2ME_LOG_LEVEL=info            # Log level: debug, info, warn, error (default: info)
    ```

4. **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage with Claude Desktop

To use this server with the Claude Desktop application, add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

### MacOS

`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Windows

`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "bit2me": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["/absolute/path/to/bit2me-mcp/build/index.js"],
            "env": {
                "BIT2ME_API_KEY": "YOUR_BIT2ME_ACCOUNT_API_KEY",
                "BIT2ME_API_SECRET": "YOUR_BIT2ME_ACCOUNT_API_SECRET"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** Replace `/absolute/path/to/...` with the actual full path to your project.

## 🛡️ Security

### Security Policy

For detailed information about reporting vulnerabilities and our security policy, please see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

### Best Practices

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control.
- **Permissions**: Use minimal permissions. Avoid "Withdrawal" permissions for MCP usage.
- **Logging**: The server automatically sanitizes sensitive data in logs.

## ⚠️ Rate Limits & Error Handling

The Bit2Me API enforces rate limits to ensure stability.

- **429 Too Many Requests**: If the server hits a rate limit, it will **automatically retry** the request after a 1-second delay (up to 3 retries).
- **Console Warnings**: You may see warnings in the logs if rate limits are hit.
- **Best Practice**: Avoid asking for massive amounts of data in a very short loop.
- **Exponential Backoff**: The server now uses exponential backoff with jitter for retries to handle rate limits more gracefully.

## 📊 Logging

The server implements a structured logging system that automatically sanitizes sensitive data (API keys, signatures).
You can control the verbosity using the `BIT2ME_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

- `debug`: Detailed request/response logs (useful for development)
- `info`: Startup and operational events (default)
- `warn`: Rate limits and non-critical issues
- `error`: API errors and failures

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Connection refused"

- Ensure the MCP server is running.
- Check that the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` points correctly to the `build/index.js` file.

### Error: "API Key invalid" or "Unauthorized"

- Verify your keys in `.env` or the Claude config.
- Ensure your API keys have the necessary permissions (Wallet, Trade, Earn, etc.) enabled in the Bit2Me dashboard.
- Check that there are no extra spaces or quotes around the API key values.

### Error: "Rate limit exceeded" or 429 responses

- The Bit2Me API has rate limits. The server automatically retries with exponential backoff.
- If you're hitting rate limits frequently, reduce the number of concurrent requests.
- Consider adding delays between operations in your workflows.

### Tools not showing up in Claude

- Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit and reopen).
- Check the Claude Desktop logs for initialization errors.
- Verify the configuration file syntax is valid JSON.

### Error: "Request timeout"

- Check your internet connection.
- Increase `BIT2ME_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` in your environment variables (default: 30000ms).
- Some Bit2Me API endpoints may be temporarily slow.

### Environment variables not loading

- When using `npx`, environment variables must be set in the config file's `env` section.
- For local development, ensure the `.env` file is in the project root.
- The server prioritizes config-provided credentials over `.env` file values.

### Error: "Network error" or CORS issues

- The MCP server runs server-side and doesn't have CORS restrictions.
- Network errors usually indicate connectivity problems or API downtime.
- Check the Bit2Me status page or try again later.

### Debugging

- Run the server manually to see logs:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
- Set `BIT2ME_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for detailed logging.
- Check Claude Desktop logs:
    - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log`

## Commit Conventions

### Rules

- **ALWAYS** use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
- **Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- **Types that trigger releases**:
    - `feat:` → Minor version bump (1.1.0 → 1.2.0)
    - `fix:` → Patch version bump (1.1.0 → 1.1.1)
    - `perf:` → Patch version bump
- **Types that DON'T trigger releases**:
    - `chore:` - Build/dependency changes
    - `ci:` - CI/CD changes
    - `docs:` - Documentation only
    - `style:` - Code style changes
    - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
    - `test:` - Test changes
- **CRITICAL: All commit messages MUST be written in English**
    - Subject line must be in English
    - Body (if present) must be in English
    - No exceptions - this ensures consistency and compatibility with tools
- **Commitlint** validates all commits via Husky pre-commit hook

### Examples

```bash
feat: add optional raw_response support in mapped responses
fix: correct wallet address mapper and add pocket details mapper
ci: improve semantic-release npm configuration
docs: add NPM badge and link to README
chore(deps): bump zod from 4.1.12 to 4.1.13
```

---

## Versioning & Releases

### Semantic Release Configuration

- **Automated versioning** via Semantic Release
- **Configuration file**: `.releaserc.json`
- **Release rules**: Defined in `releaseRules` array
- **Branches**: Only `main` branch triggers releases
- **Node.js version**: Requires Node.js 22+ (Semantic Release requirement)

### Release Process

1. Push commits with `feat:` or `fix:` to `main`
2. Semantic Release analyzes commits since last tag
3. Generates new version based on commit types
4. Updates `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`
5. Creates Git tag (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
6. Publishes to NPM
7. Creates GitHub release

### Version Bump Rules

- **Major** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes (requires `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body)
- **Minor** (1.1.0 → 1.2.0): New features (`feat:`)
- **Patch** (1.1.0 → 1.1.1): Bug fixes (`fix:`, `perf:`)

### Important Notes

- Commits `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:` do NOT trigger releases
- Semantic Release only runs on `main` branch
- Last tag determines which commits are analyzed
- If no release-worthy commits, workflow completes without error

---

## API Response Mapping

### Core Principles

- **Always map raw API responses** to optimized schemas
- **Use snake_case** for all field names (better for LLM consumption)
- **Flatten structures** - remove unnecessary nesting
- **Filter zero balances** and irrelevant fields
- **Provide defaults** for missing fields (empty strings, "0", etc.)

### Mapper Functions

- **Location**: `src/utils/response-mappers.ts`
- **Pattern**: `map<Entity>Response(raw: unknown): <Entity>Response`
- **Always validate** input with type guards (`isValidObject`, `isValidArray`)
- **Throw `ValidationError`** for invalid structures
- **Handle multiple field name variations** (e.g., `address`, `addr`, `addressValue`)

### Raw Response Support

- **Optional feature** via `BIT2ME_INCLUDE_RAW_RESPONSE` env var
- **Default**: `false` (raw responses excluded)
- **Usage**: Wrap mapped responses with `wrapResponseWithRaw()`
- **Purpose**: Debugging and completeness verification
- **Documentation**: See `docs/RAW_RESPONSE_GUIDE.md`

### Example Mapper Pattern

```typescript
export function mapWalletPocketDetailsResponse(raw: unknown): WalletPocketDetailsResponse {
    if (!isValidObject(raw)) {
        throw new ValidationError("Invalid wallet pocket details response structure");
    }

    return {
        id: raw.id || "",
        currency: raw.currency || "",
        balance: raw.balance || "0",
        available: raw.available || "0",
        blocked: raw.blocked || raw.blockedBalance || "0",
        name: raw.name,
        created_at: raw.createdAt || raw.created_at || "",
    };
}
```

### Schema Definitions

- **Location**: `src/utils/schemas.ts`
- **All schemas** must match mapper output
- **Use TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- **Optional fields** marked with `?`
- **Required fields** have defaults in mappers

---

## Testing

### Test Structure

- **Framework**: Vitest
- **Location**: `tests/` directory
- **Pattern**: Mirror `src/` structure
- **Coverage target**: 97%+ (pragmatic approach)

### Test Files

- `tests/mappers.test.ts` - Response mapper tests
- `tests/tools/*.test.ts` - Tool handler tests
- `tests/config.test.ts` - Configuration tests
- `tests/auth.test.ts` - Authentication tests

### Mocking Rules

- **Always mock** `getConfig()` in tests
- **Set `INCLUDE_RAW_RESPONSE: false`** by default in test mocks
- **Mock external API calls** (Bit2Me API)
- **Use fixtures** for consistent test data (`tests/fixtures.ts`)

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

### Test Requirements

- **All mappers** must have tests
- **All tools** must have handler tests
- **Tests run automatically** on pre-commit (via lint-staged)
- **CI runs tests** before release

---

## CI/CD Workflows

### Workflows

1. **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
    - Runs on: Push to any branch, PRs
    - Steps: Lint, Test, Build
    - Node.js: 20

2. **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
    - Runs on: Push to `main`
    - Steps: Build, Test, Semantic Release
    - Node.js: 22 (required for Semantic Release)
    - **Critical**: Requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret

3. **Deploy** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
    - Runs on: Push to `main`
    - Deploys landing page to GitHub Pages
    - Node.js: 20

### Release Workflow Steps

1. Checkout with `fetch-depth: 0` (needed for Semantic Release)
2. Setup Node.js 22 with npm cache
3. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
4. Build (`npm run build`)
5. Test (`npm test`)
6. Configure npm authentication (`.npmrc`)
7. Run Semantic Release

### Required Secrets

- **`NPM_TOKEN`**: NPM automation token (type: Automation or Publish)
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Auto-provided by GitHub Actions

---

## NPM Publishing

### Configuration

- **Package name**: `@bit2me/mcp-server`
- **Access**: Public (`publishConfig.access: "public"`)
- **Provenance**: Enabled (`publishConfig.provenance: true`)
- **Registry**: `https://registry.npmjs.org`

### NPM Token Requirements

- **Type**: Must be "Automation" or "Publish" (NOT "Read-only")
- **Scope access**: Must have access to `@bit2me` scope
- **Location**: GitHub Secrets → `NPM_TOKEN`
- **Expiration**: Set appropriate expiration (default: 90 days)

### Publishing Process

1. Semantic Release detects release-worthy commits
2. Updates version in `package.json`
3. Builds package (`prepublishOnly` hook)
4. Publishes to NPM registry
5. Creates Git tag
6. Creates GitHub release

### Troubleshooting NPM Publishing

- **Error: Invalid npm token**
    - Verify token type is "Automation" or "Publish"
    - Check token has `@bit2me` scope access
    - Verify token is not expired
    - Ensure `.npmrc` is configured in workflow

- **Error: Node version**
    - Semantic Release requires Node.js 22+
    - Update `node-version` in workflow to "22"

### File Naming

- **TypeScript files**: `.ts` extension
- **Test files**: `.test.ts` suffix
- **Use kebab-case** for file names (if needed)
- **Match directory structure** in tests

### Import Conventions

- **Use ES modules** (`import`/`export`)
- **Add `.js` extension** to imports (TypeScript requirement)
- **Group imports**: External → Internal → Types
- **Use type imports** when importing only types (`import type`)

---

## Dependencies Management

### Dependencies

- **Production**: Minimal, only runtime requirements
- **Dev**: Testing, linting, building tools
- **Update strategy**: Dependabot (weekly, grouped)

### Dependabot Configuration

- **Location**: `.github/dependabot.yml`
- **Schedule**: Weekly (Monday 09:00 Europe/Madrid)
- **Grouping**:
    - `dev-dependencies`: All dev deps together
    - `production-patches`: Production patches only
- **Commit prefix**: `chore(deps):` (doesn't trigger releases)

### Dependency Updates

- **Dependabot PRs**: Review and merge manually
- **Test locally** after merging dependency updates
- **Commit format**: `chore(deps): bump <package> from <old> to <new>`
- **No release** triggered by dependency updates

### Lock File

- **`package-lock.json`**: Always commit changes
- **Never ignore** lock file
- **Use `npm ci`** in CI (not `npm install`)

---

## Git Hooks

### Husky Configuration

- **Location**: `.husky/` directory
- **Pre-commit**: Runs lint-staged
- **Commit-msg**: Validates commit format (commitlint)

### Lint-Staged Rules

- **`*.ts`**: ESLint fix → Prettier → Vitest related tests
- **`*.{css,html,json,md}`**: Prettier only
- **Runs automatically** on `git commit`

### Commitlint

- **Config**: `.commitlintrc.json`
- **Enforces**: Conventional Commits format
- **Blocks commits** that don't follow convention

---

## Troubleshooting

### Semantic Release Not Publishing

1. **Check Node.js version**: Must be 22+
2. **Verify NPM_TOKEN**: Type must be "Automation" or "Publish"
3. **Check commit types**: Only `feat:` and `fix:` trigger releases
4. **Verify last tag**: Semantic Release analyzes commits since last tag
5. **Check workflow logs**: Look for authentication errors

### Tests Failing

1. **Mock `getConfig()`**: Required in all test files
2. **Set `INCLUDE_RAW_RESPONSE: false`** in test mocks
3. **Check fixtures**: Ensure test data matches expected format
4. **Run locally**: `npm test` to debug

### Build Errors

1. **TypeScript errors**: Check `tsconfig.json` configuration
2. **Missing types**: Install `@types/*` packages
3. **Import errors**: Verify `.js` extensions in imports

### NPM Token Issues

1. **Token type**: Must be "Automation" or "Publish"
2. **Scope access**: Verify `@bit2me` scope permissions
3. **Expiration**: Check token hasn't expired
4. **Secret name**: Must be exactly `NPM_TOKEN` in GitHub Secrets

### Git Hook Failures

1. **Husky not installed**: Run `npm install` (triggers `prepare` script)
2. **Commitlint error**: Fix commit message format
3. **Lint-staged error**: Fix linting/formatting issues

---

## Adding a New Tool

To add a new tool to the MCP server, follow this comprehensive checklist to ensure consistency, quality, and proper documentation.

### 1. Implementation (`src/tools/`)

1.  **Identify the category**: Choose an existing category (e.g., `wallet`, `market`, `earn`) or create a new one if necessary.
2.  **Create/Update file**: Edit `src/tools/<category>.ts`.
3.  **Define Tool Definition**: Add the tool definition to the `tools` array.
4.  **Implement Handler**: Add the logic to the `handle<Category>Tool` function.

```typescript
// src/tools/example.ts

export const exampleTools: Tool[] = [
    {
        name: "example_get_data",
        description: "Get example data from Bit2Me API",
        inputSchema: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
                id: { type: "string", description: "Resource ID" },
            },
            required: ["id"],
        },
    },
];

export async function handleExampleTool(name: string, args: any) {
    if (name === "example_get_data") {
        const { id } = args;
        const data = await bit2meRequest("GET", `/v1/example/${id}`);
        const optimized = mapExampleResponse(data);
        return { content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(optimized, null, 2) }] };
    }
    throw new Error(`Unknown tool: ${name}`);
}
```

### 2. Response Mapping (`src/utils/`)

1.  **Define Schema**: Add the TypeScript interface in `src/utils/schemas.ts`.
2.  **Create Mapper**: Add the mapper function in `src/utils/response-mappers.ts`.

```typescript
// src/utils/schemas.ts
export interface ExampleResponse {
    id: string;
    value: string;
    created_at: string;
}

// src/utils/response-mappers.ts
export function mapExampleResponse(raw: any): ExampleResponse {
    if (!isValidObject(raw)) throw new ValidationError("Invalid response");

    return {
        id: raw.id || "",
        value: raw.val || raw.value || "0",
        created_at: raw.createdAt || "",
    };
}
```

### 3. Registration (`src/index.ts`)

1.  **Import**: Import the tools array and handler.
2.  **List Tools**: Add `...exampleTools` to `ListToolsRequestSchema`.
3.  **Handle Call**: Add the handler condition to `CallToolRequestSchema`.

```typescript
// src/index.ts
import { exampleTools, handleExampleTool } from "./tools/example.js";

// ... inside ListToolsRequestSchema
tools: [
    // ...
    ...exampleTools,
];

// ... inside CallToolRequestSchema
if (exampleTools.find((t) => t.name === name)) {
    return await handleExampleTool(name, args);
}
```

### 4. Testing (`tests/`)

1.  **Mapper Tests**: Add test cases in `tests/mappers.test.ts`.
2.  **Tool Tests**: Create `tests/tools/example.test.ts`.

```typescript
// tests/tools/example.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from "vitest";
import { handleExampleTool } from "../../src/tools/example.js";
import { bit2meRequest } from "../../src/services/bit2me.js";

vi.mock("../../src/services/bit2me.js");

describe("Example Tools", () => {
    it("should handle example_get_data", async () => {
        vi.mocked(bit2meRequest).mockResolvedValue({ id: "123", val: "test" });

        const result = await handleExampleTool("example_get_data", { id: "123" });
        const content = JSON.parse(result.content[0].text);

        expect(content.id).toBe("123");
    });
});
```

### 5. Documentation

1.  **SCHEMA_MAPPING.md**: Add the JSON response example.
2.  **README.md**: Add the tool to the list of available tools.
3.  **Landing Page**: Update `landing/index.html` if it lists features/tools.
4.  **Product Documentation**: Update `docs/PRODUCT.md` (if applicable).
5.  **Schema Coverage**: Update `docs/TYPESCRIPT_SCHEMA_COVERAGE.md` to map the new tool to its TypeScript interface.

### 6. Verification

1.  Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass.
2.  Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation.
3.  (Optional) Run the server locally and test with a client.
