After the websocket connection you must send the JWT token or the API Key in order to authenticate the connection. If the authentication fails the websocket is closed immediately with code `4000`.\n\nWebSockets connection are limited by IP and also uses the same Rate Limiter as the HTTP calls:\n- If the maximum number of concurrent connections (50) from the same IP is exceeded a handshake error is returned with code `429`.\n- If the maximum number of messages sent (50 per second) from the same connection is exceeded, it will be closed with code `4001`.\n\nPlease also note, that you can **ONLY** receive events with a logged in account.\n## Reconnect policy\nWe recommend implementing an `on disconnect: reconnect` policy for WebSocket connections to our platform. This strategy ensures that, in the event of a connection interruption, the client will automatically attempt to reconnect, which enhances **resilience** and **user experience**.\n\nBy maintaining an active connection and efficiently reestablishing it, interruptions in communication are minimized, and a **continuous flow of data is guaranteed**, which is essential for real-time applications. This practice not only optimizes performance but also contributes to **greater stability** in interactions with our platform.\n## Code Snippets Examples\n**Example (browser-index.html)**\n```Javascript\n  <!DOCTYPE HTML>\n    <html>\n        <head>\n            <script type = \"text/javascript>\n\n            const ws = new WebSocket

get your API Keys, please get in touch with our sales team. Our knowledge base contains a detailed guide on how to work with API keys.\n\n⚠️ Never share an API key, if you suspect that an API key was compromised revoke it immediately.\n\nWhen generating an API key, you can ask us to customize it using the following scopes for the keys:\n* Read - grants access to all api endpoints, except for creating or canceling orders and transfers.\n\n* Trade - allows creation or cancellation of orders.\n\n* Withdraw - allows withdrawals (these withdrawals bypass two factor authentication).\n\nYou may optionally add an IP restriction. Any request using that API key is rejected, unless the source IP of the request is one of the trusted IPs.\n\n⚠️ Always select the minimal required scope for an api key. We recommend to set one or more trusted IPs to further harden API keys with scope Trade or Withdraw.\n\nMake sure that your client validates the server certificate and aborts if validation fails.\nFor accessing the API a valid API-Key must be passed in the header.\n<div class=\"box-info-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"box-info-title\">\n    <i class=\"material-symbols-outlined\">info</i>\n    <h6>To operate on behalf of a subaccount.</h6>\n  </div>\n\n  It is necessary to add the token that identifies it. To do this the following\n  key/value must be sent on header:\n\n    X-SUBACCOUNT-ID: <subaccount id>\n\n</div>\n\nThe following key/value must be sent on header:\n\n    X-API-KEY: FpCD1srjBT0flxgf9QbVwquzhHaJOiFiP873iEKDhj216jTLX_pTPlkV2sCqJJguskfSJv1R3j4y3SJNJbwMTo3Kai5fPD53WnZqV4w31FLBShL6y0S172c3rTwM_ydq\n\n\nNonce header is also required to be sent. The nonce value corresponds to the current value of the unix timestamp in UTC and has a valid time window of 5 seconds.\n\n  ```\n  x-nonce: 1687155308\n  ```\n\nIf request needs to be signed you have to include following header:\n\n  ```\n  api-signature: <signature>\n  ```\n\nSignature must be generated using the nonce, the request URL and the body. An example in javascript to `GET /v1/trading/wallet/balance` is shown below:\n\n  ``` javascript\n  const axios = require('axios');\n  const crypto = require('crypto');\n\n  const API_KEY = 'YOUR API KEY;\n  const SECRET = 'YOUR SECRET;\n\n  const NONCE = Date.now(); // MUST be UTC time zone\n  const PATH = '/v1/trading/wallet/balance';\n  const SERVER = 'https://gateway.bit2me.com';\n\n  const getAuthHeaders = (nonce, path, body) => {\n    const messageToSign = getClientMessageToSign(nonce, path, body);\n    const signature = getMessageSignature(messageToSign, SECRET);\n\n    return {\n      headers: {\n        'x-api-key': API_KEY,\n        'api-signature': signature,\n        'x-nonce': nonce\n      }\n    };\n  };\n\n  const getClientMessageToSign = (nonce, url, body) => {\n    const hasBody = !!body && Object.keys(body).length > 0;\n\n    return hasBody\n      ? `${nonce}:${url}:${JSON.stringify(body)}`\n      : `${nonce}:${url}`;\n  };\n\n  const getMessageSignature = (message, secret) => {\n    const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');\n    const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', secret);\n    const hashDigest = hash.update(message).digest('binary');\n    const hmacDigest = hmac.update(hashDigest, 'binary').digest('base64');\n\n    return hmacDigest;\n  };\n\n  const config = getAuthHeaders(NONCE, PATH, undefined);\n  const response = await axios.get(`${SERVER}${PATH}`, config);\n  console.log(response.data);\n\n  ```\n\n  **Important:** The body used to generate the signature must be the request body string. In javascript, it can be obtained with `JSON.stringify(body)`.\n\n  ``` javascript\n  const nonce = 1687155308;\n  const url = '/v1/trading/order';\n  const body = {\n    side: \"sell\",\n    symbol: \"B2M/EUR\",\n    price: \"0.09999\",\n    amount: \"5001.00000000\",\n    orderType: \"limit\"\n  };\n\n  const bodyString = JSON.stringify(body);\n  const messageToSign = `${nonce}:${url}:${bodyString}`;\n  const signature = getMessageSignature(messageToSign, SECRET);\n\n  const response = await axios.post(`${SERVER}${url}`, body, {\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'x-api-key': API_KEY,\n      'api-signature': signature,\n      'x-nonce': nonce\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n## TOTP\nThere are some operations that require 2FA authentication. Following headers must be included in this cases:\n* Header x-totp - contains 2FA code\n\n* Header x-totp-type - contains the type of how the 2FA code was received (Type: ['gauth', 'sms', 'email'])\n\n⚠️ For subaccount operations the totp-type always will be 'gauth'\n"

Review the maximum concurrent connection limit and the overall message per second limit at [WebSockets Rate Limit section](/#section/WebSockets)\n\n⚠️ The connection will be aborted if the request limit has been reached. ⚠️\n\n<div>\n  <table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;\">\n    <tr style=\"background-color: silver; font-weight: bold;\">\n      <th>Command</td>\n      <th>Max. messages per second</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/trading-spot-websockets#section/Authenticate\">Authenticate</a></td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/trading-spot-websockets#section/Private-channels\">Subscribe</a></td>\n      <td>50</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/trading-spot-websockets#section/Private-channels\">Unsubscribe</a></td>\n      <td>50</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/trading-spot-websockets#section/Private-commands/Add-order\">AddOrder</a></td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/trading-spot-websockets#section/Private-commands/Add-orders-(in-batch)\">AddOrders (batch orders)</a></td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/trading-spot-websockets#section/Private-channels\">CancelOrder</a></td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/trading-spot-websockets#section/Private-commands/Cancel-orders-(in-batch)\">CancelOrders (batch orders)</a></td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/trading-spot-websockets#section/Private-commands/Cancel-all-orders\">CancelAllOrders</a></td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"/trading-spot-websockets#section/Private-commands/Auto-cancel-orders-on-disconnection-(kill-switch)\">AutoCancelOrdersOnDisconnection</a></td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n# Order Limits\n\nA rate limit applies to the number of orders clients can have open on each market at one time and the number they can add and cancel orders on each market\nper hour. These limits apply to all API types ([Rest API](/trading-spot-rest) and [WebSockets API](/trading-websockets)) and according to the tier established for the user:\n\n<div>\n  <table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;\">\n    <tr style=\"background-color: silver; font-weight: bold;\">\n      <th>User</th>\n      <th>Purpose</th>\n      <th>Max.

Runs immediately. The exact price\nof the operation is not guaranteed.\n- **limit**: allows you to buy or sell at a fixed **price** that you determine, although depending on how the market moves\nyou can get a better price. It is executed when the market price reaches the set price. The order is not guaranteed\nto be executed\n- **stop-limit**: order has to set 2 prices: **stop price** and limit **price**. When the market reaches the **stop price**\nthen the order becomes a **limit** order.\n\n> Orders expire every 30 days - automatically cancelled. For partially filled orders, they will also be canceled after 30 days and the unfilled order quantity is unlocked.\n\n> Cancelled **market maker** orders not partially filled are stored for 7 days. After that period they are automatically deleted from the system.\n\n# Errors\n\n<div>\n  <table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;\">\n    <tr style=\"background-color: silver;
